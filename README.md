## Abstract
The Particle collider at CERN bombards particles close to the speed of light. This generates many subatomic particles and the 8 different particle detectors collect data about them throughout the process. This data is immense in size (25 petabytes per year) and thus bottlenecks the number of collisions the facility can perform in a given period of time.

An algorithm that predicts the supposed trajectory of particles can focus on collecting data in more focused regions. Additionally, techniques that support better storage efficiency need to be implemented alongside the algorithm for better results. This can decrease the amount of space required per collision to save its data hence possibly aiding in costs, frequency of runs, data management etc. Additionally, numerous other optimization steps can be added to this methodology to ensure the best results.
